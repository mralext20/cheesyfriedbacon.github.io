<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I am a horrible programmer. No, really. I try to spend my free time programming whether I am out, or at home.</p>
<p>Currently I have 3 Android devices, and 2 iOS devices, but I prefer Android. I am addicted to technology, and it is really sad, I know.</p>
<p>My favorite text editor is <a href="http://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 3</a>.</p>
<p>I also enjoy playing Minecraft: Pocket Edition, but I don't have Minecraft for the PC.</p><p>I have both a PC and a PS3, and my Steam ID is <a href="http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/sliceofcheese">sliceofcheese</a>.</p>
<p>This website <i>used</i> to contain a terminal environment, my blog, and way back then, a website like this but crappier.</p>
